Nate EQ
=================

About
---
A friend told me about some tool that he was trying to get working to inspect EverQuest traffic. I'm curious so I'm going to try getting it working too.

Prime Goals:
* Windows platform (despite how the original tool compiles for linux)
* Developed with an IDE with a debugger (and I like small free portable stuff) so DevC++

Development
---
* Build: Invoke `build.bat` in the root directory. Status: In progress.
* Run: Invoke `build.bat -run` in the root directory. Status: Not implemented yet.
* Test: Invoke `build.bat -test` in the root directory. Status: Not implemented yet.

Release
---
Invoke `build.bat -publish` in the root directory. The `publish` folder becomes populated with all files needed to distribute and use Nate EQ.
